On February 4th (next Tuesday) the computer science department of TUM hosts the Demo Day, an open-house event where students are invited to present the results of their projects or theses.

Due to the ongoing construction work at Marsstra√üe 20 the air conditioning will be unavailable this weekend; therefore we have to switch off all servers on Friday 5pm.
